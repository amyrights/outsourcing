Zila, Inc. designs, manufactures and markets a portfolio of proprietary products sold exclusively and directly to dental professionals. Zila, Inc. was founded in 1980, and Zila, Inc. has headquarter locations in Fort Collins, Colorado.</p>","<p><strong>Business Overview</strong><br />Zila, Inc. is a diagnostic company dedicated to the prevention, detection and treatment of oral cancer and periodontal disease. Zila, Inc. manufactures and markets ViziLite Plus with TBlue, its flagship product, for the early detection of oral abnormalities that could lead to cancer. ViziLite Plus is an adjunctive medical device cleared by the FDA for use in a population at increased risk for oral cancer. In addition, Zila, Inc. designs, manufactures and markets a suite of proprietary products sold exclusively and directly to dental professionals for periodontal disease, including the Rotadent Professional Powered Brush, the Pro-Select Platinum ultrasonic scaler and a portfolio of oral pharmaceutical products for both in-office and home-care use. Zila, Inc. is certified by the American Dental Association and the Academy of General Dentistry to provide continuing education seminars.<br /><br /><strong>Sales and Marketing</strong><br />Zila, Inc. sells its products directly to dental offices in the United States and Canada through its direct field sales force and telemarketing organization. Zila, Inc.'s marketing programs reach most U.S. dental offices and include continuing education seminars that dentists and their staffs pay to attend. These seminars are ideally suited to educate a large number of dental professionals on the importance of oral cancer screening and periodontal health. In order to achieve its vision of establishing ViziLite Plus with TBlue as the key to an enhanced standard of care for oral abnormality screening, Zila, Inc.'s overall strategy is to educate the dental professional and expand distribution among practicing dentists. Through its national sales force and the selective use of national and regional distributors, Zila, Inc. has focused on geographical markets that have demonstrated early acceptance. <br /><br /><strong>Governmental Regulation</strong><br />Zila, Inc.'s operations are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries with respect to the testing, approval, manufacture, labeling, marketing, distribution and sale of its products. Zila, Inc. devotes significant time, effort and expense addressing the government regulations applicable to its business. On an ongoing basis, the FDA reviews the safety and efficacy of marketed pharmaceutical products and monitors labeling, advertising and other matters related to the promotion of pharmaceutical products.<br /><br />The FDA also regulates the facilities and procedures used to manufacture pharmaceutical products in the United States and the sale of such products in the United States. Such facilities must be registered with the FDA and all products made in such facilities must be manufactured in accordance with the FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices. Compliance with those practices requires the dedication of substantial resources and requires significant costs. The FDA periodically inspects both Zila, Inc.'s manufacturing facilities and its contract manufacturing plants and laboratories to review compliance with applicable regulations and procedures. The FDA may recommend a recall or withdraw product approvals if regulatory standards are not maintained. FDA approval to manufacture a drug is site specific. If an approved manufacturing facility for a particular drug becomes inoperable, obtaining the required FDA approval to manufacture such drug at a different manufacturing site could result in production delays, which could adversely affect Zila, Inc.'s business and results of operations.<br /><br />In connection with its activities outside the United States, Zila, Inc. is also subject to regulatory requirements governing the testing, approval, manufacture, labeling, marketing, distribution and sale of its products, which requirements vary from country to country. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained for a product, approval of the product by comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries may need to be obtained prior to marketing the product in those respective countries. The approval process may be more or less rigorous from country to country, and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required in the United States. No assurance can be given that any clinical studies conducted outside of any country will be accepted by such country and the approval of any product in one country does not assure that such product will be approved in another country.<br /><br />Zila, Inc. is also subject to worldwide governmental regulations and controls relating to product safety, efficacy, packaging, labeling and distribution. While not all of the products that Zila, Inc. plans to introduce into the market are new, those fitting the regulatory definitions are subject to a stringent premarket approval process in most countries. Submission of a substantial amount of preclinical and clinical information prior to market introduction significantly increases the amount of time and related costs incurred for preparing such products for market.<br /><br /><strong>Competitive Landscape</strong><br />All of the industries in which Zila, Inc. sells its products are highly competitive. A number of companies, many of which have greater financial resources, marketing capabilities and research and development capacities than Zila, Inc. has, are actively engaged in the development of products that may compete with Zila, Inc.'s products. The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive and ongoing research efforts that may result in development by other companies of products comparable or superior to any that are now on the market, including those that Zila, Inc. sells.<br /><br /><strong>Weaknesses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reliance on a Few Key Products:</strong> If any of Zila, Inc.'s major products were to become subject to a problem such as loss of patent protection, unexpected side effects, regulatory proceedings, publicity adversely affecting user confidence or pressure from competing products, or if a new, more effective treatment should be introduced, the impact on its revenues could be significant. Additionally, Zila, Inc. is reliant on third party manufacturers and single suppliers for its ViziLite Plus product, and any supply problems resulting from regulatory issues applicable to such parties or failures to comply with the FDA's current standards could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition. Additionally, there is no assurance that Zila, Inc. will be able to successfully develop and integrate new products into its business that will result in growth and a positive impact on its business.</li>
<li><strong>Raw Materials:</strong> Raw materials essential to Zila, Inc.'s business are generally readily available. However, certain raw materials and components used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical and medical device products are available from limited sources, and in some cases, a single source. Any curtailment in the availability of such raw materials could be accompanied by production delays, and in the case of products, for which only one raw material supplier exists, could result in a material loss of sales. In addition, because raw material sources for products must generally be approved by regulatory authorities, changes in raw material suppliers could result in production delays, higher raw material costs and loss of sales and customers. Production delays may also be caused by the lack of secondary suppliers.</li>
<li><strong>Enforcing Proprietary Rights:</strong> Zila, Inc.'s current and future success depends on a combination of patent, trademark, and trade secret protection and non disclosure and licensing agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights. Zila, Inc. owns and has exclusive licenses to a number of United States and foreign patents and patent applications and intends to seek additional patent applications as it deems necessary and appropriate to operate its business. Zila, Inc. can offer no assurances regarding the strength of the patent portfolio underlying any existing or new product and/or technology or whether patents will be issued from any pending patent applications related to a new product and/or technology, or if the patents are issued, that any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to cover the product, technology or production process. Although Zila, Inc. intends to defend its proprietary rights, policing unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult or may prove materially costly and any patents that may be issued relating to new products and technology may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented.</li>

<p><strong></strong>Wawa Inc. operates a chain of convenience stores in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. Wawa Inc. offers breakfast, salads, hoagies and sandwiches, toasted wraps and flatbreads, wraps, and snacks, as well as soups, sides, and bowls; coffee, frozen products, dairy products, and teas and drinks; and gasoline. Wawa Inc. also provides casual sweatshirts, hoodies, and college branded clothing. Wawa Inc. was founded in 1803 and is based in Wawa, Pennsylvania.<br /><br /><strong>Wawa Inc. Revenue</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Wawa Inc. generates the majority of its revenue through its fuel and food & drink sales. Its secondary products such as apparel are sold primarily through its physical convenience stores but also online through its website. Wawa Inc. also sells gift cards.<br /><br /><strong>Costs</strong></p>
<p>The Company's most significant costs are those related to store expansion and maintenance, cost of goods sold, including gasoline and related fuel products and food service products.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Developments<br /><br /></strong>In August 2015, the company announced that the Concord Township board of supervisors approved Wawa's request to sell six packs of beer to go at their Naamans Creek Road location in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania. Now it is up to the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board to approve of the licenses for beer sales.</p>
<p><strong>Wawa Revenue Growth, Expansion, and Experimentation</strong></p>
<p>Wawa has consistently experimented with new formats and products as it has sought to grow. Following the company's expansion toward New Jersey's coastline, Wawa began to customize each store to match the scenery of their location. Sonic-style drive-in booths have been tried and abandoned, as have also tested Panera bread sit-down tables, also abandoned. Centralized baking and in-store-built hoagies have been successes. (Wawa Inc. is now the world's biggest hoagie-maker, according to PrivCo research).</p>
<p>Other experiments tried and reversed by Wawa: national taco, pizza, and doughnut concessions. Wawa has also tested stores greater than 10,000 square feet, as well as mini-Wawas between 2,000 and 3,000 square feet. Based on these tests, Wawa has settled on 5,500 square feet as the ideal size. Wawa also began adding espresso machines in its stores in 2012.</p>
<p>As of 2014, over 400 Wawa's stores sell gasoline</p>
<p><strong>Wawa Targets Florida Market</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In 2011, Wawa began studying expansion beyond its core North New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Central Virginia market. The results: Florida would be Wawa's next frontier. (Wawa considered but decided against Western Pennsylvania / Pittsburgh, given competitor Sheetz's large presence there. North and South Carolina also already had widely used QuikTrip dominating that market.</p>
<p>First up for Wawa stores in 2012 were 7 new stores in Orlando and Tampa, Florida. In July 2012, the Company says it plans to penetrate the Central Florida market over the next five weeks with additional stores in Orlando and nearby Kissimmee (two each).<br /><br />As of November 2014, there were 52 locations in Florida. The company plans to open approximate 50 total new locations in Florida by the end of 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Wawa Employee Turnover and Costs Decline in 2009-2012 Economic Slowdown</strong></p>
<p>The slow economy in 2009-2012 has made it easier for Wawa to hire and retain its largely convenience-store based hourly workers. Employee turnover in 2011 plunged to more than half compared to the prior two years, to about 40 percent annually. Land costs for new store openings were also down. That has made Wawa's growth easier: New Wawa openings rose from 10 to 12 a year in the late 2000s, to 20 new stores in 2011, with 28 in 2012, including the first seven Wawa stores in Florida.</p>
<p><strong>Wawa Launches Expanded Model Store Layout</strong></p>
<p>In June 2012, Wawa officially introduced to the public a vastly expanded and redesigned store at the heart of Center City Philadelphia, at 17th and Arch Streets. The nearly 5,000-square-foot shop included high-tech ordering and laid out in a way that emphasizes Wawa's increasing focus on hoagies, sandwiches, espresso, and other prepared foods as opposed to just dry goods. The larger and redesigned store layout was to serve as a model for Wawa's expansion into Florida.</p>",Wawa,www.linkedin.com/company/wawa-inc,www.facebook.com/wawa

Gibson Guitar Corp.'s most popular guitar is the legendary Gibson Les Paul guitar. Gibson Guitar Corp. was founded in 1902 by Orville Gibson, under former name <strong></strong>TheGibson Mandolin-Guitar Mfg. Co., Ltd. Gibson Guitar Corp. headquarters are located in Nashville, Tennessee. In 2011, Gibson Guitar Corp. was the receiving end of a federal raid seeking information supporting allegations that Gibson was illegally imported banned ebony wood to use in its guitar fingerboards. (Gibson Guitar Corp. denied the allegations). See PrivCo's Detailed Business Description: Gibson Guitar Corp. for more information on the federal raid and related allegations.</p>","<p style=""background: white;""><strong>New Beginning of Gibson Guitar Corp. (1900s-1960s)</strong></p>
<p style=""background: white;"">Gibson Guitar Corp.'s beginnings trace back to the 1880s when Orville Gibson, its namesake and founder, made his living as a salesman and clerk after purchasing a small workshop in Michigan. Orville Gibson began applying his techniques to make guitars, flutes, and banjos as well. From 1896 onwards, Orville Gibson started making instruments full time. Late 1902, Gibson entered into an agreement with five Kalamazoo financiers to create the Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Manufacturing Company. According to agreement, Orville Gibson was not a major stockholder, but was instead given a few of stock shares and a lump sum of $2,500 for his patent and the right to use his name. In July 1903, Orville Gibson sold his stock but remained at the company, Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Manufacturing Company, until 1904. Afterwards, Gibson received a monthly pension until he died in 1918.<br /><br />After Orville Gibson's death, Lloyd Loar joined the Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Manufacturing Company and refined many of Orville Gibson's original designs. The Model F-5 and Model L-5 guitars were quickly acclaimed. In 1922, Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Manufacturing Company introduced its first modern guitar as a part of the company's style 5 series. In 1924, Lloyd Loar resigned when Gibson management did not approve of one of his new radical designs. In 1929, Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Manufacturing Company began production of an economy series, the Kalamazoo line. In the 1930s, the market for guitars expanded rapidly. In 1934, Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Manufacturing Company introduced the super 400, an extra-large jazz guitar. In 1935, Gibson introduced its electric guitar, the aluminum-bodied Electric Hawaiian Guitar. In 1944, the Chicago Musical Instrument (CMI) Company acquired Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Manufacturing Company, as the war neared its conclusion. CMI prepared Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Manufacturing Company to meet the pent-up demand for guitars when the war ended. In 1948, McCarty joined Gibson and served as company's president from 1950 to 1966. In 1952, the Gibson Les Paul guitar made its debut as the first solid body, electric guitar. Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Manufacturing Company acquired Epiphone in 1957. In 1958, Gibson expanded its dealer base and introduced a whole new product line. In 1957, McCarty also led CMI to purchase rival Epiphone, giving Gibson a greater control of the market. In 1965, Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Manufacturing Company hit record production, shipping over 100,000 Gibson and Epiphone instruments in that year alone. In 1969, Chicago Musical Instruments was acquired by Ecuadorian Co., Ltd, and was renamed Norlin Music Corporation.<br /><br /><strong>An Era of Gibson Guitar Corp. (1970s -1980s)</strong></p>

In 1975, Gibson Guitar Corp. opened its Nashville factory and by 1986 it was producing only 75 guitars per day, and was selling its factory failures at discounts. In 1983, Norlin Music Corp. was taken over by Rooney Pace and Piezo Electric Product, Inc. and later the new owners promptly put the Gibson music division up for sale. In 1984, Gibson Guitar Corp. closed its Kalamazoo factory. In 1986 the new owners, Henry Juszkiewicz and David Berryman, took over the company for $5 million. In late 1987, Gibson Guitar Corp. began a series of acquisitions, including the acquisition of Steinberger.

<p style=""background: white;"">August 2011, federal agents raided offices and factories of Gibson Guitar Corp. for the second time in two years, seizing documents, computer hard drives, and pallets of wood, guitars and tools after tracing what they believed to be illegal shipments of ebony hardwood from India. The Department of Justice stated that the raid was part of an investigation into possible violations of the Lacey Act, which makes it unlawful to import wood that was exported illegally under another country's laws. The raid stopped production at two Gibson Guitar Corp. factories and an Epiphone plant in Nashville; the plants produce hundreds of guitars a day, and rosewood and ebony fingerboards, mostly imported from India, are essential components.</p>
<p style=""background: white;"">This is not the first time Gibson Guitar Corp. has been raided by federal agents, the first occurred back in 2009. Many American guitar makers use fingerboards from India, and a ban on their import could affect other U.S. guitar and musical instrument manufacturers. Gibson Guitar Corp. denied the allegations and has fought the seizure. As of April 2012, the authorities still have not filed any criminal charges against Gibson Guitar Corp. and its unclear whether or not there will ever be any charges filed. During the raid the federal agents seized half a million dollars worth of Indian rosewood and ebony, as well as guitars and computer hardware from Gibson Guitar Corp.'s factories.</p>
<p style=""background: white;"">In August of 2012, <span style=""background-color: white;"">Gibson Guitar Corp. agreed to pay a $300,000 fine to resolve a federal criminal investigation into allegations that it illegally imported wood from Madagascar and India. </span><span style=""background-color: white;"">Federal officials said that Gibson acknowledged it ""may have violated"" laws in Madagascar, a country that has struggled with illegal logging and deforestation, when the company acquired unfinished ebony fingerboards through a supplier in 2008 and 2009.</span></p>
<p style=""background: white;"">Gibson also agreed to pay an additional $50,000 to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to be used to promote conservation of tree species used in the musical-instrument industry, implement a compliance program and withdraw its claims to Madagascar ebony seized by investigators and valued at $261,844 <span style=""background-color: white;"">Mr. Asner added that the due-diligence steps Gibson agreed to follow for wood imports will likely become the standard for other companies to follow.</span></p>
<p style=""background: white;"">Under the agreement, the Justice Department said Indian law regarding ebony and rosewood exports remains unclear, and it would therefore not prosecute Gibson regarding future imports ""unless and until the Government of India provides specific clarification."" The agency said it would then give Gibson advance notice of such a change.</p>",,,

18696,"Prosper Marketplace, Inc.",Private,No,US,CA,San Francisco,2005,"Prosper Marketplace, Inc. is a privately-held, venture capital backed lending company that specializes in creating an online marketplace for people-to-people lending. Prosper Marketplace was founded in 2005 by Chris Larsen, John Witchel, and Kirk T. Inglis. Prosper Marketplace, Inc. headquarters are located in San Francisco, California.</p>","<p><strong>Prosper Marketplace Business Overview</strong></p>
<p>Prosper Marketplace operates a peer-to-peer lending platform, which allows people to lend money to other people. The goal of Prosper Marketplace is to allow both borrowers and lenders to profit from an open and transparent loan market. Prosper launched its platform in 2006 and as of December 31, 2011 has allowed over $290 million in consumer loans. Through the Prosper peer-to-peer lending process, borrowers are able to obtain lower rates and better loan terms than through traditional banks and credit cards. Prosper also gives lenders a new market for risk, which has little connection to traditional assets and stocks. Founded in 2006, Prosper Marketplace is headquartered in San Francisco, California.</p>
<p>The Prosper platform matches people willing to give loans with borrowers. The process begins with a borrower member posting a loan listing on the Prosper platform. Lender members can then review the loan listings and post commitments to lend, which, in reality, is a commitment to buy a ""Note"" that depends on the loan payments of the borrower to Prosper. Once a loan listing has reached the point that it can be funded through Note purchases, Prosper's partner bank WeBank, a Utah, FDIC insured bank, originates the loan and sells it to Prosper. Prosper then sends each lender a Note corresponding to the amount they committed to the loan.</p>
<p>A large part of Prosper's operations, besides operating and improving the platform, are in managing loan applications from borrower members. Prosper uses information from the application and credit reports to establish a loan rating called the ""Prosper Rating."" This proprietary rating system is used on the Prosper website to help inform lenders and allow them to manage their risk. Prosper also services the loans, managing payment collection and borrower interaction.</p>
<p><strong>Prosper Marketplace Revenue Model</strong></p>
<p>Prosper Marketplace generates revenue through service fees from lenders for the management of purchased Notes and transaction fees from borrowers upon loan origination. Revenue growth comes from increasing the amount of loans that Prosper originates through its partner WeBank. In 2011, Prosper originated $75,138,000 in loans. In 2010, Prosper originated $26,940,000 in loans. In order to facilitate loan origination, Prosper seeks to attract new lenders and borrowers to its platform as well as retain existing users. Prosper achieves this by boasting lower rates and emphasizing the social networking effect of its platform. As a result, many of Prosper's loans are between families and friends. Lenders can be individuals or institutions. Borrowers are mostly consumers looking for consumer loans for large purchases or payments such as car purchases or mortgage payments.</p>
<p><strong>Prosper Risk Management</strong></p>
<p>A key part of Prosper's operations are its risk management capabilities, which include loan rating, historical loan data collection, and information provision to Prosper lenders. Prosper uses a letter grade rating system with 7 levels, each corresponding to a particular annualized loan loss rate range. Prosper constantly updates the rating system to reflect historical loan data. Prosper monitors loans with similar characteristics and uses historical loss rates to give new loans ratings. Also, using Prosper historical data, Prosper develops the ""Prosper Score"" alongside the ""Prosper Rating."" The Prosper Score determines the probability of a loan going 60 days past due in the 15 months after the loan is originated. The Prosper Scores uses a proprietary risk model based on past Prosper borrowers. In addition to its proprietary tools, Prosper also integrates a credit score from Experian.</p>
<p><strong>Competitive Landscape</strong></p>
<p>The peer-to-peer lending industry is relatively new and rapidly growing as consumers and lenders are becoming more aware and accepting of internet financing services. Peer-to-peer lending platforms such as Lending Club and Pertuity offer similar loan markets to Prosper's. Furthermore, Prosper competes with traditional credit sources such as credit card companies and banks. For example, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Citibank can offer customers similar loans. Also, as a new industry, barriers to entry are relatively low, allowing new entrants to take market share away from Prosper. The main points of competition within the industry are website usability and design, brand recognition, fees and terms, interest rate offerings, and lender returns. </p>
<p><strong>Competitive Strengths</strong></p>
<p>Prosper boasts both proprietary risk management and proprietary platform technology. This allows Prosper to offer a differentiated product from competing online lending services. Furthermore, Prosper's platform is highly scalable, allowing Prosper to facilitate a large volume of loans efficiently. The Prosper rating system allows letters to better manage their risk and provides accurate information on loans.</p>
<p>Prosper has spent significant time and money to obtain regulatory approval of its platform. In order to offer similar services, competing firms would have to go through similar registration processes, which require ample resources and time. As a result, Prosper has a significant advantage over competitors that seek to replicate Prosper's operations.</p>
<p>Prosper allows members to access an open and transparent market for loans. Data and information on loans is readily and easily available, allowing lenders to optimize their portfolios and better interpret the market. Moreover, the openness of the platform gives borrowers a better chance at getting loans since they can access a wider range of borrowers than through traditional channels.</p>
<p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p>
<p>A significant risk to Prosper is loan fraud. Prosper is extremely attentive to loan management and fraud detection. However, loan fraud could have significant effects on the Prosper brand name and reputation. To combat the possibility of fraud Prosper uses third party identification and a separate investigative team to analyze flagged loans.</p>
<p>Prosper relies on a large amount of intellectual property to give its business a competitive advantage over competing services. For example, Prosper's legal agreements with lenders and borrowers and proprietary technology are all unique properties of Prosper. Competing services may copy or reconstruct similar capabilities, rendering Prosper's advantages useless. This could lead to extensive legal costs to protect intellectual property and more competitors in the industry.</p>
<p>Other risks come from the fact that Prosper operates in a new and rising industry. For example, borrowers may view Prosper loans as less significant than traditional loans, leading to slower repayment or higher default rates, eliminating the benefits to lenders. Furthermore, laws surrounding online peer-to-peer lending platforms are relatively new and are subject to change. Laws and regulation could limit Prosper's ability to collect loan payments effectively. Incorrect interpretation of laws could also lead to drastic negative effects on Prosper.</p>",,,

Additionally, Appirio runs a crowdsourcing, collaborative website for developers called Cloud Spokes, which offers cash prizes for crowdsourced IT solutions.

<p>Appirio's primary source of revenue is consulting. The company helps big companies like Honeywell, Genentech, and Dolby to adopt cloud solutions and manage other technological change. Appirio's clients pay the cloud integrator around $40k-$60k per engagement, with some projects yielding hundreds of thousands of dollars in consulting fees. </p>
<p>Fortunately for Appirio, big companies are willing to pay this much a more efficient information technology system that promises to reduce Appirio's clients' expenses even further. Also, Appirio is cheaper than its older consulting competitors currently involved in IT services. Appirio says its use of Google Apps is 1/5 the cost of IT solutions provided by other consultancies. </p>
<p><strong>Costs</strong></p>
<p>Appirio's most important asset and its biggest expense is its workforce. The IT services firm can only expand as fast as it attains the appropriate talent, which it pays about $70k-$100k in salary. In addition to the hundreds of consultants it employs, Appio is also involved in research and development of new products and services for its clients.</p>
<p><strong>Expansion</strong></p>
<p>Further growth in Appirio's topline will come from growth internationally. The December 2011 acquisition of Saaspoint helped the company expand into the UK, acquiring both the firms' talent and its client relationships. In the future, further acquisitions of smaller IT consultancies seems likely. </p>

Items on Fab.com are typically for sale for only a short time, and the company's target market tends to be the fashion-conscious luxury consumer. Fab.com began as a gay social networking site called Fabulis until the company pivoted in 2011. Fab.com was founded in 2010 by Jason Goldberg and Bradford Shellhammer, and has headquarters located in New York, New York.</p>","<p><strong>Fab.com Revenue and Business Model<br /></strong></p>
<p>Fab.com originally began in 2010 as a gay social networking site called Fabulis.com. It had attracted 50,000 members in its first three months, only to stagnate nine months later at 130,000 members and 30,000 active members. In March 2011, founders Jason Goldberg and Bradford Shellhammer decided to rebrand their company into an online flash-sale site: Fab.com.</p>
<p>Fab.com is now an online, high end ""flash sales"" website that features various consumer products, including art, furniture, gadgets, kitchen tools, apparel, food, and bathroom accessories. The website also features various social media tools, including design inspiration boards that customers can build and share. The company is headquartered in New York, New York.<br /> <br /> <strong>Revenue Model</strong></p>
<p>Fab.com earns its revenues through members' purchases of items, with Fab.com having over 6 million members as of 2012. Fab.com generates revenue streams from charging its members an undisclosed markup on the products they buy. The products which the company sells through its website come from outside suppliers, which include over five thousand designers. Revenues are correlated with the amount of members the site has as well as the disposable income of its members. As of early 2012, the company generates approximately $1.5 million in revenue on a weekly basis.<br /> <br /> About 40% of Fab.com's sales come from home decor products, with the majority of the rest of sales coming from items such as clothing and jewelry. The company uses several distribution channels, such as mobile and social media. Mobile apps for the Android, iPhone, and iPad platforms were launched in 2011, and account for about 30% of sales. In 2012, about 15% of daily traffic came from Facebook and 5% from sites like Twitter.com and Pintrest.com. The site operates outside the United States, generating revenues in Canada and Europe.<br /> <br /> <strong>Expense Model</strong><br /> <br /> As an online retail company, Fab.com's overhead costs are limited. Relevant costs include the purchase of inventory from suppliers, negotiation fees, transportation and shipment of products to consumers, and administrative fees.<br /> <br /> Fab.com has primarily grown through word of mouth, making marketing costs lower than average retail sites. In March 2012, the company hired its first Chief Marketing Officer.<br /> <br /> <strong>Risks</strong></p>
<p>Competition in the online retail industry is fierce. Fab.com's online flash sale offerings have to compete with already established sites like Groupon and Gilt Groupe. Fab.com tries to differentiate itself by selling only niche lifestyle products.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing Strategy</strong></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">September 2012 Purchase Of Ad Placement OnFacebook's Log-Out Page</span></p>
<p>To capture the company's large portion of users who are directed to the website through social sharing, Fab.com employs a targeted marketing strategy, using its funds raised to purchase ad-placements on Facebook's Log-Out page. Users are able to comment on the ad, and click on it through to Fab's sales page. In addition, Fab.com uses a targeted strategy to restrict the ads to Facebook users over 21.Although Facebook log-out page advertisements can be expensive (more than $700,000 per day), Fab.com has relied on Facebook to grow its membership base and drive sales. The company has also used the ""sponsored stories"" tactic to promote the site to friends of its fans and drive them to the sales website.<br /> <strong>Recent Developments</strong></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Funding</span></p>
<p>When Fab.com was still a social networking site, it was owned by founder Goldberg, several angel investors and venture capital firms. Goldberg had originally provided Fabulis with $500,000 of his own money as seed capital. Goldberg and Shellhammer then raised another $1.8 million from angels and venture firms First Round Capital and Menlo Ventures before reincarnating the company as a flash sales website for high-end design goods. (Bradford Shellhammer previously worked at modern home goods company Design Within Reach and modern design magazine Dwell.)</p>
<p>Since its re-branding as a flash-sale site, several additional angel investors and venture capital firms have invested in the company. Fab.com raised several million dollars in additional capital in the summer of 2011 based on its new business model, going on to raise significant venture capital subsequently. <br /> <br /> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Fab.com's International Expansion</span></p>
<p>In January 2012, Fab.com made its first acquisition with FashionStake. Throughout the rest of 2012, Fab expanded aggressively into international (non-U.S.) markets.Following Fab's acquisition of Casacanda, a German flash sales website in February 2012, Fab's European expansion added 13 more countries across Europe, bringing Fab to 16 countries worldwide by May 2012. By June 2012, Fab expanded its operations to Sweden, Poland, and Cyprus.<br /> <br /> In mid-June 2012, Fab added Canada as its 20th market. (Previously Canadian users accounted for 3%-5% of Fab.com traffic, despite Fab not having shipped there until June 2012.) At launch, over 80% of Fab's products shipped to Canada at a $10 flat rate. The new Canadian members use the Fab.com domain. Meanwhile, overseas, customers were still directed to Fab.de, its German website, but by end of 2012 all of Fab customers were directed to the central ""Fab.com"" website.<br /> <br /> To celebrate the 1-year anniversary of Fab.com, Fab launched Fab UK by acquiring British online home goods retailer Llustre.com.. Like Fab.com, Fab UK specializes in limited-edition pieces and exclusive design-driven product retail. Fabs currently sells designs costing up to about $20,000 daily with new products appearing on a daily basis. At the time of the acquisition, Fab.com's 2012 run rate was for sales of $150 million.<br /> <br /> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Site Redesign Focuses on ""Social Shopping""</span></p>
<p>In June 2012, Fab redesigned its website to focus users' attention more on social shopping and less on the flash sales element of its service. Prior to the website change, iPhone users were two times more likely to buy than others, iPad users were four times more likely to buy, but Fab ""social users"" were nearly ten times more likely to make a purchase through Fab.<br /> <br /> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Massive New Capital Injection; New Fulfillment Centers; Fab Retail Stores Planned</span></p>
<p>In July 2012, Fab.com raised substantial new venture capital growth funding.</p>
<p>Fab's CEO said the company planned to use the new money to improve its shipping times so that customers can get orders more quickly. To do that, Fab began working on setting up fulfillment centers in New Jersey and on the West Coast. At the time, the company set a goal to have Fab customers can expect items to ship same-day by the end of the year.</p>

<p>By September 2012,Fab.com abandoned the sign-up requirement that asks visitors to sign in before they can view the catalog of products, allowing more new and anonymous users to their site. This change is due to Fab.com's shift from aflash-sales site focusing on mostly home goods to a design-centric e-commerce site that sells everything from food to fashion and features not just flash sales, but verticals that allow shopping without countdowns. Fab.com realized thatsign-ins were ""frustrating to users"" and no longer a good business move given their current business model.</p>

20239,"Palantir Technologies, Inc.",Private,No,US,CA,Palo Alto,2003,"<p>Palantir Technologies, Inc. is a privately-held, venture capital backed data visualizations and analysis solutions company that offers data integration, visualization, and analytics information solutions. Palantir Technologies was founded by Alexander Karp, Peter Thiel, Joe Lonsdale, Stephen Cohen and Nathan Gettings in 2003. Palantir Technologies headquarters are located in Palo Alto, California.</p>","<p><strong>Palantir Company Overview</strong></p>
<p>Palantir Technologies, Inc. is a privately-held software developer that offers platforms for integration, visualization, and analysis of data. Named after a magical communication device used by wizards in the popular series ""Lord of the Rings,"" Palantir seeks to uphold its namesake as a tool used for analyzing information around the world.<br /> <br /> Palantir offers two products: Palantir Gotham (formerly Palantir Government) and Palantir Metropolis (formerly Palantir Finance). The two platforms are dedicated to organizing and visualizing data in a way that maximizes ease of understanding and allows efficient use of human expertise.<br /> <br /> <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Palantir Gotham</span></em><br /> <br /> Palantir Gotham is an information analysis platform that is geared towards a variety of fields, including intelligence, defense, financial regulation, cyber security, and healthcare.<br /> <br /> After the terrorist attack of 9/11, the U.S. government significantly increased its efforts to cross reference personal data from the population. This was met with fierce opposition from activist groups that viewed it as a violation of privacy. The debate became quickly heated in the ensuing years and escalated into a dilemma between national safety and rights to privacy. Palantir Gotham was created as a potential answer to this issue.<br /> <br /> Palantir Gotham was originally developed to help track government activities in profile screening as well as label accessible information. It makes it much easier for government auditing agencies to supervise the activities of the CIA, FBI, and other agencies.<br /> <br /> Palantir Gotham quickly evolved into a much more powerful platform. Agencies like the CIA and FBI use the platform to collect information and detect patterns regarding suspects gathered from minor data trails that the platform can collect from other agencies and companies, such as credit card usage and hotel sign-ins. The software then turns these surveillance videos, credit statement reports, and hotel rental lists into a meaningful visual report that helps the user decipher patterns.</p>
<p>The modern version of Palantir Gotham has expanded beyond just government uses and is employed by many organizations across a variety of disciplines for the purpose of data analysis.<br /> <br /> <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Palantir Metropolis</span></em><br /> <br /> Palantir Metropolis is a spin-off of Palantir Gotham, designed for financial analysis. Used by hedge funds, investment banks, and other financial institutions, Palantir Metropolis collects and analyzes mission critical data for financial markets. While similar with Palantir Gotham in functionality, Palantir Metropolis is programmed with functionality specifically designed for financial fraud detection, economic patterns, and credit security protection.</p>
<p><strong>Palantir Revenue Model</strong></p>
<p>Palantir generates revenue streams through the sale of software products to organizations. Their clients include government agencies, financial institutions, and healthcare groups. The contracts allow clients to use Palantir's proprietary technologies to analyze information and generate solutions.</p>
<p>Palantir charges between $5 to $100 million for each contract, depending on the size and specialization of the client and the level of service required. The company asks for 20 percent of that money up front and the rest only if the customer is satisfied at the end of the project. <br /> <br /> <strong>Palantir Expense Model</strong><br /> <br /> Palantir's costs include SG&A expenses. The company has hired aggressively over the past 5 years. however salaries are capped that tend to be low by Silicon Valley standards. Employees are further compensated by fringe benefits, which include food, events, and activities paid for by Palantir. The company also compensates employees through equity grants and bonuses, designed to further motivate employees to further the growth of the company.</p>
<p>The company must also invest in research and development for their proprietary software. Their data-driven analysis products and services must be maintained and updated in order to accommodate for any shifts in information trends.</p>
<p>Other costs include the expansion of the company, such as the purchase of new offices and land.</p>
<p><strong>Palantir Company History</strong></p>
<p><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Lawsuit by competitor i2</span></em></p>
<p>In February 2011, competitor firm i2 filed a court complaint against Palantir. According to i2, Palantir employee Shyam Sankar obtained i2 software representing himself as a principal of SRS Enterprises, a company registered under the names of his parents in Florida. Sankar then allegedly proceeded to analyze i2's software and use the results to develop tools to import data from i2?s software for use in Palantir's analytical tools. Palantir's public image was especially damaged by this complaint since its finance software is designed to prevent and detect fraud. Fortunately, Palantir's retort to the lawsuit was also damaging for i2's public image. As a result, the case was quickly settled. The lawsuit was one of the more prominent of several complaints against Palantir that have potentially damaged its public image.<br /> <br /> <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Participation in Wikileaks attack</span></em></p>
<p>Palantir was responsible for participating in Bank of America's plan to attack Wikileaks, a nonprofit group with the goal of obtaining and releasing sensitive documents into the public domain. The company's action was ironically against its vision of ""making the unseen connections visible and intelligible."" CEO Alex Karp released a public apology for Palantir's involvement.<br /> <br /> <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Offices and Facilities</span></em></p>
<p>Beginning in 2012, Palantir Technologies has reportedly been acquiring new office properties at a rapid pace. Most notably, it is rumored they have taken over the immense commercial property once occupied by the book retail giant Borders. Expanding companies such as Palantir have undoubtedly contributed to the skyrocketing real estate costs in the Silicon Valley area. In October 2014, Palantir signed a lease to the former garage building at 430 W. 15 St in New York City. The lease is for over 75,000 square-feet, including portions of the ground and lower levels and the 2-7 floors, plus the enclosed glass roof and terrace areas.<br /> <br /> <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">US Army signs deal with Palantir</span></em></p>
<p>On October 4th, 2012, the U.S. Army approved a $19 million contract with Palantir Technology for use of Palantir's Counter-IED (Improvised Explosive Device) Software. The majority of the contract involves the Marine Corps, with soldiers having requested Palantir equipment, training, and technical support in prior scenarios.</p>
<p><strong><br /></strong>In September 2015, Palantir and Landmark (a Halliburton business line and provider of software for the upstream oil and gas industry) formed an alliance to develop a fully integrated economics, planning and decision support framework.<br /><br />In January 2015, Palantir announced that they would be opening an office in Seattle (Pioneer Square area) in Q1/Early Q2.</p>
<p><strong>Founding</strong></p>
<p>Palantir's origins lie within Paypal's operations. When Paypal was founded in 1998, the company was under chronic attack by money launderers and fraud. In response, Paypal had its engineers train computers to detect suspicious transactions. The financial criminals, however, would simply work around the algorithms Paypal's engineers developed and circumvent detection. Neither computer nor human analysis was enough to counter the issue.</p>
<p>Paypal's computer scientists then began to build a more elaborate software system, where each transaction was treated as part of a pattern rather than a standalone entry into a database. This information was combined with information gathered on individuals' computers and business associates. The data and analysis that resulted from this software was subsequently examined by both computers and humans in order to identify any suspicious patterns. It enabled Paypal to freeze suspicious accounts before financial crime could be committed.</p>
<p>When Paypal was acquired by eBay in 2002, Peter Thiel, an eBay executive, started his own hedge fund. Thiel, along with Joe Lonsdale (another Paypal employee) decided to use Paypal's fraud detection to further his business. Peter Thiel and Joe Lonsdale, along with Alex Karp, Stephen Cohen and Nathan Gettings, received $30 million from Thiel and his firm, The Founders Fund, as well as $2 million from the CIA venture branch In-Q-Tel. These investments in turn gave birth to Palantir.</p>",PalantirTech,www.linkedin.com/company/palantir-technologies,www.facebook.com/Palantir

<p><strong>Clients</strong></p>

Founded in 2004, 4INFO is headquartered in San Mateo, California.</p>","<p><strong>Business Overview</strong></p>
<p>4INFO provides SMS, display, and mobile advertising solutions to advertisers and brands. 4INFO SMS services reach millions of mobile phone users in the United States. Besides SMS, 4INFO also provides advertising services for iPhone and Android targeted applications and websites including rich mobile ad experiences and display ad placement and management. 4INFO seeks to be a one stop shop for mobile advertising campaigns providing everything from display ads to customized mobile solutions. 4INFO has offices in San Mateo, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and Boston.</p>
<p>4INFO SMS services allow publishers to send out SMS updates to millions of subscribers. 4INFO provides updates for sports scores, news, weather, travel, and entertainment content providers. In addition to publishing services, 4INFO runs ad campaigns using the information gathered from subscribers. </p>
<p>4INFO's AdHaven division develops a mobile ad platform that allows for customer targeting using data gathered through 4INFO's extensive SMS and mobile advertising campaigns. 4INFO also gathers information from advertising publishers which provide 4INFO with their own customer information to increase the effectiveness of the 4INFO platform. Application developers utilize the 4INFO AdHaven platform to maximize their mobile application revenue. </p>
<p><strong>Revenue Model</strong></p>
<p>4INFO generates revenue through fees from advertisers and brands for the use of 4INFO's mobile advertising and SMS advertising platforms. SMS platform prices can range from $15,000 to $75,000 a month for large brands and advertisers. Overall revenue streams are relatively stable given that advertising campaigns can range from weeks to months and require constant updating and renewal. Revenue growth comes from the attraction of new publishers to the SMS service or from the introduction of new advertisers and brands to 4INFO advertising services.</p>
<p>As of January 2011, mobile display advertising accounts for 80% of revenue, while SMS messaging only accounts for 20%. This means that 4INFO has converted some old SMS customers to mobile advertising or has managed to get customers to use both services. Cross selling of SMS to mobile and vice versa has the potential to further grow 4INFO's revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Competitive Strengths</strong></p>
<p>4INFO boasts the largest SMS advertising platform. This allows 4INFO to leverage the vast amounts of user information from SMS campaigns in its additional online, application, and mobile advertising services. Additionally, 4INFO's SMS database allows it to link publisher data and user information with phone numbers. Thus, 4INFO has an advantage over competing mobile advertising solutions, which do not have the same database to draw from.</p>
<p><strong>Competitive Landscape</strong></p>
<p>4INFO competes with both large and small advertising services providers. Although 4INFO dominates the SMS advertising and publishing industry, it faces heavy competition in the online and mobile ad markets. Companies such as Apple, which acquired Quattro, and Google, which acquired AdMob, have developed their own mobile advertising platforms that overlap with the capabilities of 4INFO's services. The main points of competition in the mobile space are return on investment for advertisers, revenue maximization for developers, consumer information databases, and mobile platform cross compatibility.</p>
<p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p>
<p>Movement away from SMS advertising campaigns has the potential to remove a significant portion of 4INFO's revenue. 4INFO has moved more towards mobile advertising services, but some resources are still dedicated to SMS. Thus, the shrinking market for SMS advertising is a minor risk factor that is already pushing 4INFO towards the AdHaven mobile platform instead of SMS publishing.</p>
<p>4INFO also risks being overshadowed by larger ad platforms. Google and Apple's ad platforms are optimized and built for their own mobile operating systems, and have the potential to take market share away from 4INFO if they are not already. Thus, it may be more difficult for 4INFO to retain and attract large advertisers and brands leading to lower revenues and smaller market share.</p>
<p><strong>Key Acquisitions</strong></p>
<p>4INFO's acquisition of Butter in June, 2010 signaled 4INFO's continued focus on mobile advertising over its traditional SMS advertising services. Butter provided rich advertising experiences for both the Android and iOS platforms. The acquisition extends 4INFO's mobile services into customized app experiences and mobile web advertising design and integration.</p>
<p><strong>Developments</strong></p>
<p>In July 2011, 4INFO partnered with Datalogix to provide AdHaven customers extended reach in their advertising campaigns. The partnership combines the Datalogix and 4INFO databases to increase the potential audience for advertisers.</p>",,,

TOMS also markets and sells coffee through its existing distribution channels, which include its website and retailers like Whole Foods Markets. TOMS Shoes, Inc.'s signature item is its line of <em>alpargata</em>-style canvas shoes. TOMS Shoes has a philanthropy-integrated business model through its ""One for One"" program, which donates a pair of shoes or provides vision care with every purchase of either shoes or sunglasses, respectively [see exhibit for discussion on local economic effects]. TOMS Shoes, Inc. was founded in 2006 by Blake Mycoskie, and the company's headquarters are located in Santa Monica, California.</p>","<p><strong>Business Model</strong></p>
<p>TOMS Shoes, Inc. is a privately held company that manufactures and sells footwear, eyewear, apparel and coffee. TOMS Shoes, Inc. operates manufacturing locations in China, Ethiopia, and Argentina, where shoes are produced on a made-to-order basis, and expects by 2015 to perform 50% of all its manufacturing in the markets its philanthropy serves. <br /><br />TOMS Shoes, Inc. is publicly committed to adhering to fair labor practices and sourcing labor and environmentally conscious materials. (For more information, see ""Corporate Responsibility"" below.) For every item bought online or in stores, TOMS Shoes, Inc. donates a pair of shoes, eye glasses, or provides vision care for someone in need. TOMS Shoes, Inc. follows a ""philanthropic capitalism"" business model premised on simultaneous revenue growth and philanthropic advancement.<br /><br />Similarly, the company launched TOMS Roasting in 2014; with each purchase of coffee, the company works with ""giving partners"" to provide 140 liters of safe water (a one week supply) to a person in need.</p>
<p><strong>Revenue</strong></p>
<p>TOMS Shoes, Inc. generates revenue through the wholesale of its products to third party retailers, including Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, and Whole Foods, as well as through its own online website.The classic canvas shoes cost about $45, while other styles can cost up to about $100. TOMS Shoes, Inc. also offers a product line that caters specifically to vegans that contains no animal-based materials. TOMS Shoes, Inc.'s offers sunglasses in many styles for both men and women, and range from $120-$150 per pair. Similar to its model with shoes, TOMS donates to charities that provide eyeglasses to people in need. In 2014, TOMS announced that it will begin selling fair-trade coffee through its existing sales channels, typically high-end markets, with the goal of further monetizing its customer base and staying ""top of mind"" among them between sales for their canvas shoes.<br /> <strong><br />Costs</strong></p>
<p>TOMS Shoes, Inc.'s primary costs are raw material and equipment purchases, facilities maintenance and expansion, and labor expenses in design, manufacturing, sales, and corporate divisions. TOMS Shoes, Inc. incurs relatively little marketing expenses as it communicates with consumers and the public primarily through social media and public relations engagements such as fashion shows, campus-based community service initiatives, and advertising partnerships with companies such as AT&T. TOMS Shoes' biggest cost center is its philanthropic activities.</p>
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<p>TOMS Shoes, Inc.'s ""philanthropic capitalism"" model garnered a lot of publicity upon the company's launch in 2006, and has helped distinguish their brand from its competitors. The company has been particularly successful at capturing younger demographics by integrating retail fashion, civic engagement, and the increasingly popular trend towards ""greener"" and labor-friendly manufacturing.</p>
<p><strong>Risks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Intellectual property theft or legal action</li>
<li>Brand and reputation damage</li>
<li>Competition, particularly from other socially conscious consumer product brands</li>
<li>Changing consumer tastes</li>

<p><strong>Recent Developments<br /></strong></p>
<p>In August 2015, founder and CEO Blake Mycoskie announced that he would be taking 12 weeks off after the birth of his son. Mycoskie said his paternity leave would serve 2purposes: to spend time caring for his newborn baby and to set an example for his employees.</p>
<p><strong>Company History</strong></p>
<p>While competing on the second season of the popular reality television show, ""The Amazing Race,"" Blake Mycoskie visited Argentina and noticed that many children did not have the means to buy shoes. Mycoskie found that shoes for children was an important public welfare cause because Argentina's shoeless children were subject to a variety of health risks and were not allowed to attend school. Upon returning to the United States, he founded ""Shoes for Tomorrow Project,"" a company dedicated to donating a pair of shoes to a child in need for every pair sold. ""Shoes for Tomorrow Project"" gradually evolved into TOMS Shoes.</p>
<p>Mycoskie started TOMS with $300,000 of his own money in his loft apartment in Venice, California, having each pair specially made to order. By October 2006, TOMS moved into a warehouse located in Santa Monica, CA, where TOMS Shoes, Inc. maintains its headquarters today.</p>
<p><strong>Philanthropy</strong></p>
<p>Friends of TOMS, the company's non-profit foundation, is responsible for organizing volunteer activities, shoe and glasses donations, as well as the vision care that its beneficiaries receive. Friends of TOMS is not a corporation-backed foundation that the company supports through donations; rather, it is a necessary part of TOMS' distinct business model. Friends of TOMS leads three service initiatives: One Day Without Shoes, World Sight Day, and Ticket to Give. One Day Without Shoes and World Sight Day raise awareness about health risks associated with not wearing shoes, visual impairment, and blindness around the world. Ticket to Give is an opportunity for TOMS supporters to partake in volunteer service trips to distribute the company's donations in different countries. Friends of TOMS also provides resources to students through their website,www.tomscampusprograms.com,to help spread awareness of their campaign and become involved with the company's philanthropic efforts.</p>

50599,Kixeye,Private,No,US,CA,San Francisco,2007,,"<p><strong>Business Overview</strong></p>
<p>Kixeye is a privately-held social game developer specializing in enhanced gaming experiences for social media platforms including Facebook. The company's popular titles include Backyard Monsters, Battle Pirates and War Commander. With these titles and other titles currently in development, the company is targeting the ""hardcore gamer"" audience, a demographic that is traditionally willing to pay for games. Kixeye focuses on high production quality, user engagement and user retention.</p>
<p>Kixeye is focused on developing games for the browser, a relatively new platform for gaming. Although the company has already achieved considerable traction with its current offerings, the current gaming experience via Facebook and the internet browser still falls short of the full console gaming experience to which many hardcore gamers are typically accustomed. In that respect, the company sees significant potential in its future offerings which will maximize higher quality 3D graphic technology. The company is investing heavily in game development that can enable web-based games to take advantage of 3D hardware in computers via technologies such as Adobe Flash 11.2 and Unreal Engine 3.</p>
<p>Kixeye will expand beyond its current portfoloio of strategy games. The company hopes to launch 3 to 4 new titles in 2012 including an action role-playing game. By 2013, the company plans on launching a larger-scale MMO (massively multiplayer online) game similar to the popular World of Warcraft.</p>
<p><strong>Revenue Model</strong></p>
<p>Kixeye's games are free to play. However, the company generates revenues through the sale of virtual goods to highly engaged users that are willing to pay for the opportunity to better compete in games. The company estimates that 6%-9% of players are paying customers. In contrast, the paying customer segment for Zynga, a major competitor in the social gaming space, is only 2%-3%. The company also estimates that it retains its customers for five times longer than other popular social games. This results in an average revenue per daily active user of up to 20 times more than the 4 cent average for social games daily active users.</p>
<p>Unlike major competitors, Kixeye does not generate revenues through advertising and will continue to focus on developing games of high production value that can generate more money per user. Kixeye's target audience, ""hardcore gamers,"" are traditionally used to paying $30-$60 per title for consoles which range in price of $150-$300. The company sees significant potential in being able to redirect a portion of their target audience's budget towards their online social gaming platform. The company has been profitable since January of 2011 and raised additional venture capital funding in August 2011.</p>
<p><strong>Distribution</strong></p>
<p>Making games accessible via Facebook will continue to be the focus of Kixeye's distribution as it is a highly efficient way to gain access to new users. Facebook has more than 800 million users and has a dedicated team focused on improving distribution of gaming on its platform. Kixeye has also partnered with Viximo, a cross-platform distributor of online social games. Viximo distributes Kixeye's Backyard Monsters to the Yahoo Games and Yahoo Messenger platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Competition</strong></p>
<p>The online social game space is increasingly competitive. Kabam, Inc. is a direct competitor of Kixeye that also focuses on the ""hardcore gamer"" demographic. The company has raised $130 million in funding and has expanded distribution to more than half a dozen platforms. Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts, developers for traditional gaming consoles, are diversifying into the online social gaming space by offering existing popular titles such as Command & Conquer and The Sims. Zynga, a pioneer in online social gaming, has over 240 million users and raised more than $1 billion in an initial public offering in December 2011.</p>",kixeye,,

Stitch Fix, Inc. was founded in 2011 by Katrina Lake and its headquarters are located in San Francisco, California.</p>","<p><strong>Business Model:</strong></p>
<p>Stitch Fix adds a personal styling layer on top of the traditional subscription box model. Customers initially fill out a brief survey about their style preferences, sizes, budget, and any upcoming social events they may want to dress for. The company then employs data analytics and a proprietary algorithm which helps determine which items a customer is most likely to purchase. Stitch Fix sends out a box of five items to the customer, charging a $25 styling fee which may be credited toward the purchase of any of those five items. &nbsp;If a customer decides to purchase all five items, she receives a 25% discount on the sum of the order. If the customer chooses not to purchase any of the items, she is still charged the $25 styling fee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stitch Fix buys most of its inventory in wholesale, like traditional retailers, but the company also has six in-house private label brands which account for 30% of total sales. The average price of items is $55. The company has achieved a 70% purchase rate, where 70% of customers purchase at least one item from their delivered box.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Developments:</strong></p>
<p>In March 2015, after analyzing customer data and feedback, Stitch Fix added&nbsp;maternity and petite styling to its offering, the company's first expansion into new product categories outside of standard women's sizes 0-14.</p>
<p>In September 2015, the company announced plans to scale its operations in the Southwest with the opening of a distribution center in Phoenix - its fourth nationwide - for which it will hire up to 600 employees over the next 12 to 18 months. The company already has distribution centers in&nbsp;South San Francisco, Indianapolis and Dallas.&nbsp;</p>",stitchfix,www.linkedin.com/company/stitch-fix,www.facebook.com/stitchfix
